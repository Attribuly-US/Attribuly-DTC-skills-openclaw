## 🎯 Attribuly Unique Value Proposition

**Why Attribuly Daily Pulse is superior to native platform dashboards:**

| Metric | Native Ads Managers | Attribuly | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|----------------|
| **ncROAS** | ❌ Not available | ✅ `new_order_roas` | See TRUE incremental value daily |
| **ncPurchase** | ❌ Not available | ✅ `new_lead_conversions` | Track new customer acquisition daily |
| **Profit** | ❌ Not available | ✅ `profit` | Know if you're profitable TODAY |
| **Margin** | ❌ Not available | ✅ `margin` | Daily profitability check |
| **LTV** | ❌ Not available | ✅ `ltv` | Customer quality indicator |
| **Cross-Channel View** | ⚠️ Siloed dashboards | ✅ Unified | One view of all channels |
| **True ROAS** | ⚠️ Inflated 30-60% | ✅ First-party data | Accurate daily performance |

**Key Insight:** Daily monitoring with Attribuly catches problems BEFORE they become expensive. A single day of poor ncROAS can indicate creative fatigue, audience saturation, or budget waste that platforms won't show you.

## Skill Purpose

Provide a **quick, actionable daily snapshot** of marketing performance. Focus on:
1. **Anomaly Detection** — Flag anything unusual immediately
2. **Spend Pacing** — Are we on track for daily/weekly budget?

## Data Sources

### Primary APIs

#### 1. Get Yesterday's Totals
**Endpoint:** `POST /{version}/api/all-attribution/get-list-sum`
**Purpose:** Get aggregated totals for yesterday.

```json
{
  "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "end_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "dimensions": ["channel"],
  "model": "linear",
  "goal": "purchase"
}
```

#### 2. Get Channel Breakdown
**Endpoint:** `POST /{version}/api/all-attribution/get-list`
**Purpose:** Get breakdown by channel for yesterday.

```json
{
  "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "end_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "dimensions": ["channel"],
  "model": "linear",
  "goal": "purchase",
  "orders": [{"column": "conversion_value", "order": "desc"}],
  "page": 1,
  "page_size": 100
}
```

#### 3. Get Campaign-Level Data (for anomalies)
**Endpoint:** `POST /{version}/api/get/ad-analysis/list`
**Purpose:** Drill down to campaign level when anomalies detected.

```json
{
  "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "end_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "dimensions": ["channel", "campaign"],
  "model": "linear",
  "goal": "purchase",
  "orders": [{"column": "spend", "order": "desc"}],
  "page": 1,
  "page_size": 50
}
```

## Default Parameters

| Parameter | Default Value | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| `model` | `linear` | Full Impact attribution |
| `goal` | `purchase` | Focus on purchase conversions |
| `dimensions` | `["channel"]` for summary | |
| `page_size` | `50` | Smaller for daily (faster) |

---

## Date Range Calculation

### Yesterday (Primary)
```
yesterday_start = TODAY - 1 day
yesterday_end = TODAY - 1 day
```

### Same Day Last Week (Comparison)
```
last_week_same_day_start = TODAY - 8 days
last_week_same_day_end = TODAY - 8 days
```

### Week-to-Date (Pacing)
```
wtd_start = Most recent Monday
wtd_end = TODAY - 1 day
```

**Example (if TODAY = 2025-03-18, Tuesday):**
- Yesterday: 2025-03-17 (Monday)
- Same Day Last Week: 2025-03-10 (Monday)
- Week-to-Date: 2025-03-17 to 2025-03-17 (just Monday so far)

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Fetch Yesterday's Totals
Call `get-list-sum` API for yesterday.

### Step 2: Fetch Same Day Last Week
Call `get-list-sum` API for the same day last week (for DoD comparison).

### Step 3: Calculate Day-over-Day Changes
```
change_percent = ((yesterday_value - last_week_value) / last_week_value) * 100
```

### Step 4: Check for Anomalies
Flag any metric with:
- **Critical**: |change_percent| > 30%
- **Warning**: |change_percent| > 20%
- **Notable**: |change_percent| > 15%

### Step 5: Fetch Channel Breakdown
Call `get-list` API with `dimensions: ["channel"]` for yesterday.

### Step 6: Identify Top/Bottom Performers
- Top 3 channels by revenue
- Bottom 3 channels by ROAS (if spending)
- Any channel with $0 conversions but >$100 spend

### Step 7: Check Spend Pacing
Compare actual spend vs. expected daily spend (weekly budget / 7).

### Step 8: Generate Quick Insights
Apply anomaly detection logic and generate 3-5 bullet points.

## Daily Pulse Best Practices

### For the AI Agent
1. **Be concise** — Daily pulse should be scannable
2. **Lead with alerts** — Critical issues first
3. **Use emojis** — Visual status indicators (✅🟡🔴)
4. **Compare to same day last week** — Day-of-week matters for DTC
5. **Always show ncROAS** — The most important Attribuly metric
6. **Include profit** — Revenue without profit is vanity

### For the Client
1. **Check daily pulse every morning** — Catch issues early
2. **Act on critical alerts immediately** — Don't wait for weekly
3. **Use pacing to adjust budgets** — Stay on track
4. **Trust Attribuly over platform dashboards** — First-party truth
